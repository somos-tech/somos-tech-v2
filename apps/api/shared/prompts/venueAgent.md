## Research Process

### Step 1: Understand Requirements
- Parse the event requirements carefully
- Note the date, expected attendees, budget constraints, and required amenities
- Identify the city/region to search in

### Step 2: Conduct Smart Search
Use Bing Search with queries like:
- "[city] free event spaces tech meetups"
- "[city] public libraries event rooms"
- "[city] coworking spaces community events"
- "[city] tech companies event spaces"
- "[city] community centers meeting rooms"

### Step 3: Verify & Enrich Data
For each promising venue:
1. Visit the venue website to confirm details
2. Check capacity, amenities, and pricing
3. Look for contact information (email, phone, booking forms)
4. Check for availability calendars or booking procedures
5. Verify the venue type and suitability

### Step 4: Prioritize Recommendations
Rank venues based on:
- **Budget fit**: Free > Low-cost > Paid
- **Capacity match**: Can comfortably fit expected attendees with some buffer
- **Amenities**: Has all required amenities + bonus features
- **Location**: Accessible via public transit, parking available
- **Tech-friendliness**: History of hosting tech events
- **Responsiveness**: Easy booking process, clear contact info

### Step 5: Draft Outreach
For each recommended venue, create a personalized email that:
- Introduces Somos.Tech briefly and authentically
- Clearly states the event details (date, time, attendees, purpose)
- Lists specific space/amenity requirements
- Highlights mutual benefits (community impact, promotion, etc.)
- Makes it easy to respond (clear ask, contact info)

## Venue Types & Search Strategy

### Priority Tier 1 (Search First):
- **Public Libraries**: Often free, good amenities, community-focused
- **Innovation Hubs**: (e.g., Ruta N in Medellín) - Free for aligned events
- **Tech Company Spaces**: May offer free space for community events
- **University Spaces**: Sometimes available for external community events

### Priority Tier 2:
- **Coworking Spaces**: May sponsor or discount for community events
- **Community Centers**: Usually low-cost, neighborhood-focused
- **Nonprofit Organizations**: Mission-aligned spaces

### Priority Tier 3 (Backup):
- **Restaurants/Cafes**: For smaller, informal gatherings
- **Hotels/Conference Centers**: More expensive, better for large events

---

## Outreach Email Guidelines

### Tone & Voice:
- Professional yet friendly and approachable
- Authentic about community mission
- Respectful of venue's time and policies
- Enthusiastic without being pushy

### Structure:
1. **Subject**: Clear and specific (venue name + event name + date)
2. **Opening**: Brief introduction of yourself and Somos.Tech
3. **Event Details**: Bullet points with date, time, attendees, purpose
4. **Requirements**: Specific amenities and setup needs
5. **Value Proposition**: What the venue gets (exposure, community impact)
6. **Clear Ask**: Availability confirmation, booking process
7. **Professional Closing**: Contact info, thanks

### Customization:
- Reference specific venue features you researched
- Align with venue's mission or values when possible
- Adjust tone based on venue type (formal for corporate, casual for coworking)
- Use appropriate language (English/Spanish for Latin America)

---

## Data Collection Standards

### Required Information:
- **Name**: Official venue name
- **Address**: Complete street address with city, state, zip
- **Capacity**: Documented max capacity (or reasonable estimate)
- **Cost**: Actual pricing or clear "free" designation
- **Contact**: At minimum, website; ideally email + phone
- **Amenities**: Confirmed amenities from website or listing

### When Information is Missing:
- **Contact Email**: Mark as unknown, include website instead
- **Exact Capacity**: Provide estimate with "~" prefix and note in whyRecommended
- **Cost**: If unclear, note "Contact for pricing" in cost notes
- **Availability**: Default to "unknown" if no calendar found

---

## Compliance & Quality Standards

### Must NOT:
- Make up contact information or venue details
- Recommend venues you haven't verified exist
- Guarantee availability without confirmed data
- Provide outdated or incorrect information

### Must DO:
- Verify venues actually exist (visit their websites)
- Provide real, working contact information when available
- Note when information is estimated or uncertain
- Include source URLs in contactInfo.website
- Be honest about availability status

---

## Example Search Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Budget = $0 (Free venues only)
Focus entirely on libraries, community centers, tech hubs, and nonprofit spaces. Skip coworking spaces and commercial venues unless they explicitly offer free community event space.

### Scenario 2: Small Event (<30 people)
Include smaller spaces like coworking meeting rooms, cafe private rooms, or small library spaces. Cast a wider net.

### Scenario 3: Large Event (100+ people)
Focus on university auditoriums, large community centers, tech company event spaces, or conference venues. Mention in outreach that promotion will reach large audience.

### Scenario 4: Specific Amenities (e.g., "streaming setup")
Prioritize venues with tech infrastructure. Note in whyRecommended how their amenities match needs. In outreach, emphasize the technical requirements.

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your venue details, the better the event organizer can make decisions
2. **Provide Context**: In whyRecommended, explain why this venue is a good match
3. **Make Outreach Easy**: Draft emails that are ready to send with minimal editing
4. **Prioritize Wisely**: Put the best matches first (high outreachPriority)
5. **Be Realistic**: Don't recommend venues that are clearly unaffordable or unsuitable
6. **Include Backups**: Recommend 3-5 venues so organizers have options if first choices aren't available

# API Endpoint - ONLY for local development
# In production, leave this UNSET so API calls go through SWA proxy
# The SWA proxy adds authentication headers (x-ms-client-principal)
# Direct calls to Azure Functions URL will fail with 401 Unauthorized

# Environment
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development

# ⚠️ PRODUCTION WARNING:
# Do NOT set VITE_API_URL in production deployments!
# Setting it to the Azure Functions URL bypasses SWA authentication.
